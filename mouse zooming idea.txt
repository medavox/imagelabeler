 the x and y of the image (scaled) plus the x,y coords of the mouse X

the same proportion of the image is above & below (and left and right) 
	of the mouse as before zooming took place

mentally drawing a frame (centered around the mouse) around the part of the image which will be visible
after zooming -- no, that will centre the zoomed image on the mouse

visible pixels above = mouse Y -1
visible pixels below = viewport height - mouse Y

visible pixels left = mouse X -1
visible pixels below = viewport width - mouse X

tota pixels above =
